Implemented a neural network from scratch in NumPy to predict bike rentals.

Data Set Size: 17379 Records

Data Set<br>
Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to  
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.

Built a convolutional neural network using PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.

Main Tasks
- Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds from Scratch using PyTorch
- Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds using Transfer Learning from a VGG16 Model

Data Set<br>
[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/), Size: 13233 records<br>
[Dog Data Set](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip), Size: 8351 records
